# Contact List App
A simple AngularJS app to get and display contact information form an API.

### To Setup:
`npm install`

### To Run:
`npm start`

### To Test:
`npm test`
Note: Tests are not yet working.  The app setup using webpack and the ES6
import notation makes module injection for testing more difficult.  I need
to do more research on this matter before I will be able to complete the
unit tests.
